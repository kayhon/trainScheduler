# trainScheduler<br>
https://kayhon.github.io/trainScheduler/<br>
<strong>Overview</strong><br>
In this project I created a train schedule application that 
incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My 
app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. 
This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, 
namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they 
arrive at their station. The times are calculated based on current 
time.<br>
When adding trains, Users must enter then submit the following data:<br>
Train Name<br>
Destination<br>
First Train Time<br>
Frequency<br>
This app then calculates when the next train will arrive; relative
to the current time. Moreover, Users from many different machines 
will be able to view the same train times and additional data.<br>
<strong>Setup</strong><br>
I used Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup the project, and GithHub Pages to host my finished site.<br>
HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / Bootstrap Framework / jQuery / Firebase Database / Moment.js
